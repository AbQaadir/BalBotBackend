# RAG System Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This documentation explains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system implementation using FastAPI, Pinecone, and OpenAI. The system is designed to provide detailed information about the Ballerina programming language by combining document retrieval with AI-generated responses.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### Vector Database (Pinecone)
- Stores document embeddings
- Enables semantic search functionality
- Managed through Pinecone's cloud service

#### Language Model (OpenAI)
- Handles text generation
- Creates embeddings for queries
- Processes retrieved context to generate responses

#### API Layer (FastAPI)
- Provides HTTP endpoint for queries
- Handles request/response formatting
- Implements error handling

## Key Features

### 1. Document Retrieval
- Uses semantic search to find relevant documents
- Retrieves top 3 similar documents for each query
- Tracks document sources for transparency

### 2. Context-Aware Responses
- Combines retrieved documents with user queries
- Uses specialized prompt template for Ballerina-related questions
- Maintains context relevance in responses

### 3. Logging and Monitoring
- Comprehensive logging system
- Tracks queries and responses
- Monitors retrieval performance

## System Flow
1. User submits query through API endpoint
2. System converts query to vector embedding
3. Pinecone searches for relevant documents
4. Retrieved documents are formatted and combined with query
5. OpenAI generates contextual response
6. Response and sources are returned to user

## Configuration
- Environment variables for API keys and model selection
- Configurable logging levels
- Flexible prompt templating system

## Error Handling
- Input validation for queries
- Exception handling for empty queries
- Graceful handling of service failures

## Performance Considerations
- Asynchronous API endpoint
- Optimized document retrieval (k=3)
- Efficient response formatting

This RAG implementation provides a robust foundation for building a knowledge-based Q&A system focused on the Ballerina programming language.
